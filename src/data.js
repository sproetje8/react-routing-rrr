    'What?': `Reduce means to make something less in size, amount, degree,  importance, or price (dictionary.cambridge.org).\n 
      Reduce the amount of materials and goods you consume. This might mean limiting the amount of purchases you make in the first place. Do you really need another bottle of nail polish, or another pair of black shoes? To determine your true needs and avoid impulse buys, try the three day rule: if you want to buy something non-essential, wait three days. If you're still thinking about it three days later, then you can buy it. More than likely, you will have forgotten about it.\n
      There are other ways to reduce your consumption without limiting purchases. Buying foods in bulk often means less packaging waste. Buying in bulk is useful if you are sure you will need the full quantity you're buying. Otherwise, it could be wasteful if you can't use all of the goods before they expire.\n
      Budgeting can also help you reduce resource consumption. If you are thinking about a new computer, but your old computer works well, save up your money little by little until you can afford a new one without using a credit card or payment plan. By the time you've gotten the money saved up, you may actually need the new computer, or you may have realized there's a better use for your saved-up money.\n    
      Turning off lights when you're not in the room, unplugging electronics when not in use, and fixing drippy faucets are other ways to reduce your consumption of essential resources. It will also lower your utility bills - bonus!`,

  reuse: {

    Reusing is the act of taking old items that you might consider throwing away and finding a new use for them.\n
